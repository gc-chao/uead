UMC (Unicode Modifier Converter) Tool and Vulnerability Analyzer
================================================================

This artifact contains the source code, binaries, and evaluation cases for the paper. The toolset includes a vulnerability analyzer (with three scanners) and the UMC tool for converting modifier letters to base Latin characters.

Directory Structure:
-------------------
- src/analyzer/:
  Contains the source code for the vulnerability analyzer, which includes:
    - Parameter scanner: Explores the parameter space of CompareStringW.
    - Character scanner: Identifies characters that CompareStringW treats as equivalent.
    - Program scanner: Discovers system programs affected by the vulnerability.

- src/checker/:
  Contains the source code for the UMC tool (a GUI application) that demonstrates the conversion of modifier letters to base Latin characters.

- src/libumlec/:
  Contains the dynamic link library (DLL) for the UMC functionality.

- bin/Debug/ and bin/Release/:
  Contain pre-built binaries (executables and DLLs) for both debug and release configurations. The Release version is recommended for performance.

- report/:
  Contains three scan reports generated by the vulnerability analyzer:
    1. Parameter space scan report.
    2. Equivalent character mapping report.
    3. At risk system programs report.

- case/:
  Contains all the evaluation cases used in the paper (Section 6).

- umla.sln:
  The Visual Studio 2013 solution file for building the entire project.

Dependencies:
------------
- Windows 10 or later.
- Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013 (vcredist)
  - The x86 version is required to run the tools.
  - If not already installed, download from Microsoft's official website:
    [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784)
- Visual Studio 2013 (only required for building from source)

Quick Start:
-----------
1. For running the UMC tool (checker):
   - Navigate to the bin/Release/ directory.
   - Run `checker.exe` to launch the UMC tool.
   - In the tool, enter a string with modifier letters (e.g., "ᵗᵉˢᵗ") and click "Convert" to see the conversion.

2. For running the vulnerability analyzer:
   - The analyzer is a command-line tool. Run `analyzer.exe` from the bin/Release/ directory.
   - It has three modes: parameter scan, character scan, and program scan. Use command-line options to select the mode.

Building from Source:
--------------------
1. Open `umla.sln` in Visual Studio 2013.
2. Build the solution in Release mode.
3. The built binaries will be in the bin/Release/ directory.

Note: The vulnerability analyzer and UMC tool are built for Windows x86-64.
